# Hi there

My name is Soraya and I'm a front-end development learner. After a HTML & CSS introduction course on Khan Academy I created my (first website from scratch)[https://sorayav.github.io/first-website] (pardon my code!).
I'm currently exploring other courses, projects and the wonderful world of the version control systems (pardon my random merges!).

Thanks for checking!
