# Hi there

My name is Soraya and I'm a front-end development learner. I'm currently studying on my own with great and open resources (Khan Academy, The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, etc.) while creating small projects such as static websites.

I'm also exploring the wonderful world of the version control systems and so I apologize beforehand for the random merges you'll see here.

Thanks for checking!
